# AMZN_DATA_SCRAPE

This Amazon Data Scraping python program is a set of four files: 
1. The run.py file, which is to be ran.
2. The amazon_scrape.py file, which scrapes the data from Amazon
3. The textual_analysis.py file, which gathers the TF-IDF from reviews of the given products.
4. The data_model.py file which currently tries to apply regression but doesn't do much else. 
> This part is still in progress, and will eventually include sentiment analysis and a visual representation of the data.
