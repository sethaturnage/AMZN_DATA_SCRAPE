            "Text": "I haven't read through this translation, yet. But I liked the introduction. Quite agree that Nietzsche in his own words is far more lucid that any treatment he gets from professional philosophers. \"The Gay Science\" probably is my favorite book by Nietzsche, followed by \"The Dawn.\" Both written soon after he left academia. Nietzsche at his most exuberant... something that is not usually associated with him. His health was returning and he was just beginning to discover his (unparalleled) powers of expression.  Good as a guide to good writing, even if the reader should find much to disagree with. Not his most influential book, because of the style. But I believe that in it that he mentions the eternal recurrence for the first time. A good introduction to Nietzsche if the reader is interested in a provocative read. Not for the reader who wants to be conversant in intellectual small talk. \"The Antichrist\" or, perhaps, \"The Twilight of the Idols\" would be better for that. I find \"The Will to Power\" almost unreadable, but I have been criticized for not citing it in my writing."
