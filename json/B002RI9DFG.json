            "Text": "If you have not read this I must ask why.  Then I must ask you to ask yourself why. Anything by Nietzche is not just interesting and a learning experience, it is hillarious as well.  despite the label of being a nihlist, given by people who never read him or disagree with him, Nietzche has a profound insight to life that is actually quite joyous-not just in this work but in general.  I suggest every book he has, mind you I am biased as I was a philosophy major and had to read him anyway, bvut I had read him befor that too. It's worth it to buy this alone or better yet buy a collected works that includes his other work as well."

            "Text": "We are in 1871, have a good look around. There are people defending that life should be \"serious\"; no novels, no theater, no music\u2026 But here comes Nietzsche with a counterargument! He warms up assuming that you know a great deal about Greek tragedy. And goes around asking: Why humans need art? Well, ordinary lives are full of drama but the variation between tragedy and triumph is not in the same magnitude as in mythology. In his own words: \"Tragedy forces us to look at the terrors of individual existence, yet we are not to be petrified with fear\".  And the pleasant side is a supreme gratification from nature. Thus art sets the bounds for WONDER, so humans are set for ACTION. Once in motion, humans are no longer artists but a work of art."

He is not to be read quickly, because in so doing you will miss the point.  Worth reading and reflecting on, particularly if you study philosophy seriously."
